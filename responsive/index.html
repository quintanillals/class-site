      We want to see interesting things, make your mind speak, it’s all relevant.
      Be messy! Be risky! Don’t be in a tradition- its mutable, don’t be default, what in your field is visual or aesthetic.
      Captions need to be what it does for you and the world around you not what it is, we can see what I is. if you were too print it out large format what would you want to show your audience.
      No table of contents, test it on your laptop, show a 9 year old, not so much fine print, variety of media,  (3 projects in multiple projects? Vs 10 projects represented in a different way).
      Only show me a website if the structure of the website is what you’re showing me.
