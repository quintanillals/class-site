      Heatwave
    </h1>

    <p>
      This city is hot, and only getting hotter
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Remnants of redlining still plague the city.</li>
      <li>Income inequality is rampant. </li>
      <li>The numbers are scary: the wealthiest 5% in Richmond recieve 29% of the cities aggregate wealth while the poorest only receive 2.4%.</li>
      <li>State, Federal, and local policies have subsidized the development and proliferation of predominately white suburbs in urban metropolitan areas for much of the 20th century. </li>
      <li>Urban cities like Richmond are littered with dark hard impervious surfaces that create a variety of issues</li>
      <li><i>“Heat-islands”</i> extend heatwaves and amplify high heat and the effects of global climate change.</li>
      <li>Racial segregation, financial innequality, and the city of Richmonds negligent pursuit of development in low-income neighborhoods has set up the perfect storm for heat-island formation. </li>
    </ul>
