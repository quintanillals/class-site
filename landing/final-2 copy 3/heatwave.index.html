    <h1>
      Top of the List!
    </h1>

    <p>
      Leslie Cochran for Mayor 2000
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>These arent Radical ideas and we're still grappling with the issues leslie was running on.</li>
      <li>Leslie Cochran won 7.7% of the cities vote May 6th, 2000, second only to Kirk Watson who's  short lived climb up the political ladder culminated in a disastrous loss to Greg Abbott.</li>
      <li>This loss cemented Greg Abbott's legacy as the attorney general for all ill-informed Texans. Things could have gone differently.</li>
      <li>This city is <strong>HOT!</strong></li>
      <li>The traffic is <strong>UNBEARABLE!</strong></li>
      <li>The train goes largely <strong>IGNORED!</strong></li>
      <li>Our salamanders are in <strong>DANGER!</strong></li>
      <li>The unhoused go <strong>OVERLOOKED!</strong></li>
      <li>We are more vulnerable than ever, why couldn't Leslie Have one?</li>
      <li>Why wasn't this a cogent, <i>viable,</i> option for our city?</li>
      <li>Leslie is an anti-monument to my past.</li>
